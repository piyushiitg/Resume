    \textbf{Proxy Signature Scheme and its application}\vspace{0mm}\\\vspace{0mm}%
    \textsl{Network Security and Cryptography}  \hfill \textsl{July 2009 -- June 2010}
       \begin{itemize}
	\item Proxy Signature allow the original signer to delegate his signing power to a person 
         called proxy signer  who can replace the original signer, in case of temporal absence ,lack of time or computation power etc.
        We evaluate the existing scheme and proposed an efficient and secure proxy signature scheme based on Elliptic Curve 
        Cryptography.
